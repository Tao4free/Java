Task: given the head of a binary tree, nake a method to print out the edges of the binary tree in two different rules determing edges
    rule1:
    1. head node is edge
    2. leaf node is edge
    3. the node should be the edge if it locates at most left or right

    rule2:
    1. head node is edge
    2. leaf node is edge
    3. nodes on the path along the left  edge are edges
    4. nodes on the path along the right edge are edges

    example:
                1
              /   \
        2               3
        \               /\
        4              5  6
       /\             / \
      7  8           9  10
          \          /
           11       12
           /\       /\
         13  14   15 16

    rule1: 1,2,4,7,11,13,14,15,16,12,10,6,3
    rule2:1,2,4,7,13,14,15,16,10,6,3


Constrains:
1. time complexity O(N), extra space complexity O(h), h is the height of binary tree
2. both of the two rules should print out all edges in counterclockwise order without repetitive nodes
