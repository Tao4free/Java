Task: given a array without replicated elements, create a method to generate a MaxTree of this array

Constrains:
1. if array length is N, time complexity should be O(N), extra space complexity is O(N)

Supplements:
1. define a binary tree as following:
public class Node {
    public int value;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}
