Task: given a single linkedlist, make a method to remove duplicates. 

e.g. given a linkedlist 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> null, after removing the duplicates, the linkedlist should be 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null

Constrains:
Method1: if the length of linkedlist is N, time complexity should be O(N)
Method2: the space complexity should be O(1)
