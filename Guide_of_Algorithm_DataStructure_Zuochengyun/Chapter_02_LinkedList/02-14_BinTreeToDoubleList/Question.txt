Task: given a binary tree, to make a double linkedlist.

Info: for a binary tree, it contains value and two pointers to poitto the left and right child; for a double linkedlist, it contains value and two nodes which one point to the last node and next node. they are similar to each other in structure.

Constrains:
Method1. use queue or other data structure to complete the task. time complexity is O(N), extra space complexity is O(N)
Method2. use recursive method to complete the task. time complexity is O(N), extra space complexity is O(h), h is the height of binary tree.
